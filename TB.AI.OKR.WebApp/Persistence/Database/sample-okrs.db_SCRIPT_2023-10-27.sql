Violation: "Add some cool new features to our product", "Talk more with our customers", "Do more social media stuff", and "Make the office more fun" are not measurable as they lack specific metrics or criteria.
Rule_19: An Objective should be inspirational.

Violation: "Make things better than they are now" is generic and lacks a visionary or inspirational aspect.
Rule_39: A Key Result must be specific.

Violation: All the key results in the set are vague. For instance, what does "cool new features" or "more social media stuff" specifically mean?
Rule_40: A Key Result must be attainable.

Violation: Without specific details or metrics, it''s challenging to determine if the key results are attainable.
Rule_41: A Key Result must be relevant.

Violation: "Make the office more fun" might not directly relate to the objective of making things better in terms of business outcomes or specific targets.
